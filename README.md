# Into the Unknown: Assigning Reviewers to Papers with Uncertain Affinities

We assume that we don't know the affinity scores between reviewers and papers precisely. Instead, we have an uncertainty set where the affinity scores lie with high probability. We can then find the allocation that maximizes the worst-case of the objective over this uncertainty set of possible affinity scores.

This repository implements the experiments found in the paper Into the Unknown: Assigning Reviewers to Papers with Uncertain Affinities. Arxiv link to come.
